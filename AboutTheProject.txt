This project explored the effectiveness of high engagement through virtual immersion to increase the retention of
foreign language vocabulary. This was done by comparing a traditional flash card style learning program against an
interactive Virtual Reality(VR) program. The VR program is designed to increase the engagement and immersion of an
individual while they study. VR offers a new medium for foreign language learning, by allowing for physical interaction
between the participant and a digital representation of the word they are learning "VR learning environments
represent a promising technology that is now being widely adopted in the educational field." We thought it would
be beneficial to further explore this technology in a language learning environment.
